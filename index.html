            <p>NPTEL/HOITS QUESTIONS SOLUTIONS</p>
            <p>1.Discuss the Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Arrays.</p>
            <p> Solution:
                Some of the advantages of arrays are mentioned below: <br>
                • Code Optimization: Efficient storage and retrieval with concise code. <br>
                • Functionality: Supports algorithms for searching, sorting, etc. <br>
                • Index-Based Access: Quick element access using an index. <br>
                • Multi-Dimensional: Manages complex data structures like matrices. <br>
                • Memory Allocation: Consecutive storage minimizes overhead. <br>
                • Foundational Use: Basis for other data structures like stacks and
                queues.</p>
            <p>
                Some of the disadvantages of arrays are mentioned below: <br>
                • Fixed Size: Static data structure with a fixed size. <br>
                • Memory Wastage: Allocated memory may not be used efficiently. <br>
                • Insertions and Deletions: Costly operations as elements have to be 
                shifted. <br>
                • Data Wastage: Even if fewer elements are stored, space is allocated. <br>
                • Speed: Searching can be slow in an unsorted array. <br>
                • Overhead: Additional space is required for an index.
            </p>
            <p>
                2.What Are the Disadvantages of Using Linked Lists? <br>
Solution: Linked lists are a commonly used data structure in computer
science and are frequently discussed in data structure interview questions,
but like any other, they come with certain drawbacks. <br>
Some key disadvantages include: <br>
• Slow Access Time: Accessing elements in a linked list can be time-
consuming, as you must traverse the list to find the desired element,
an O(n) operation. This makes linked lists less suitable for scenarios
requiring quick access to elements. <br>
• Pointers or References: Linked lists rely on pointers or references to
connect nodes, which can add complexity compared to arrays. This
complexity can make linked lists harder to understand, debug, and
maintain. <br>
• Higher Overhead: Linked lists involve higher overhead compared to
arrays since each node requires additional memory to store a
reference to the next node. <br>
• Cache Inefficiency: Linked lists are inefficient in terms of cache usage
because the memory is non-contiguous. As you traverse a linked
list, cache misses are more likely, resulting in slower
performance. <br>
